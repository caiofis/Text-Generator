# Text-Generator
This project studies the use of recurrent neural networks, more precisaly LSTM networks, in caracter-level text generation.
The neural net is trained using an txt file from a book from the Project Gutenberg.
It will be tested:
* Multiple architectures
* Diferent languages 
* Train the network with diferent books at the same model
